<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> Briefly explain the connection process</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The way that the server side of the connection works by starting with<br>the &quot;ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);) part of the code. This part of<br>the code createse a socket and then binds it with a port number.<br>This port number is what the clients use to connect to it. The<br>server is then listening for incoming connections and then the client can try<br>to connect and the server accepts this connection request and creates a new<br>socket for the connection. The server and client then communication. For the client<br>side connection to work, the client connects to the sockets port number and<br>when the server accepts the connection, the client and server now communicate. The<br>socket steps until the server is waiting for messages from the client start<br>with the server creating sockets that bind to a port number. The server<br>listens for incoming connections. The client can connect to the servers port number<br>and if the server accept the connection request, it creates a new socket<br>for the connection. The server can now send and receive data through the<br>sockets. The client can now send data to the server and the server<br>can recieve and process it. This can continue til the connection is closed<br>or terminated.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>This screenshot is for #1,2,3 &amp; 4. This screenshot shows success because it<br>has clients isaac and Test both connected to the server on localhost:3000. It<br>also shows how client isaac said hi and client Test said hello. The<br>sever also broadcasted the message to all clients in the room because client<br>isaac was able to see his own text and client Tests message and<br>client Test was able to see  his own message and client isaac&#39;s<br>messsage. The message is also able to clearly show who the message is<br>from via name. When client isaac said hi, everyone in the connected to<br>the server recieved the message as,  &quot;isaac: hi&quot;<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>In this screenshot I demonstrated how client isaac created a room called test2<br>while client test created a room called test1. After that I also showed<br>in the screenshot how isaac said hello to everyone in that room and<br>client test said hello to everyone in his room. Neither client isaac or<br>client teset got the other persons message. We can further prove that this<br>worked because I showed the server terminal recieving both messages from client isaac<br>and client test and broadcasting it to everyone in their respoected rooms.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the messages are sent, broadcasted, and received</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>From the client&#39;s perspective when sending a message, the program creates a message<br>object that contains the clients message and data such as the clients username<br>and the room its being sent.&nbsp; From the serverthread, when a message is<br>sent, the serverthread is responsible for managing the communcation between the server and<br>the client. The send method in the Serverthread is whta is actually responsible<br>for sending themessage to the client in their respectible rooms. Room is responsible<br>for respresenting the chat room and clients in it. It can add and<br>remove clients, broadcast messages to all the clients in this room, and process<br>the commands that are sent by clients. It also can clean up when<br>the chat room is terminated. From the client&#39;s perspective when receieving it processes<br>the incoming message and is updated to show the new message in the<br>terminal.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

</td></tr>
</table></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Briefly explain how the various disconnects/terminations are handled</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The server doesn&#39;t crash from clients disconnecting because when a client disconnects, the<br>server program can catch exceptions and continues. The server can run without any<br>crashes.&nbsp; Same for the client when the server disconnects or is termindated. The<br>client program has code such as &#39;catch (exception e) { System.out.println(&quot;Connection dropped&quot;); break;}.<br>It also uses the private void close(){} to not be able to crash<br>and instead provide a message of what happened.&nbsp; When a client gets discconected,<br>the clients socket is closed. On the server this will indicate that a<br>client has been disconnectd.&nbsp;<br><br></p><br></td></tr>

Specifically<br>with the last part of this assignment such as understanding how and why<br>the clients and server don&#39;t actually crash. It&#39;s a simple concept but when<br>you try to undertand and answer why they don&#39;t crash, you have to<br>go a bit more in depth to figure and understand the logic behind<br>it.<br></p><br></td></tr>
